# OptimitazorProject
My first mini-project on working on files and folders ( Object-Oriented Programming ).
# Brief information about the mini-project
On the eve of 10/12/2023, I was researching the topic working with folders and files from Object-Oriented Programming in C#. After some searching and some understanding of the subject, one topic remained unclear to me.
I wonder if we can make the directory we entered in a better form? For example, we all have many types of files in our downloads folder. Why not collect them in certain folders? Why not keep it in better shape?

That is why I tried to write a program as short as possible in the console application. I included my specific folders for testing and it worked correctly.
It is inevitable that there may be some amateur mistakes in my code, it should be taken into account that I wanted to realize the idea that I had in my mind while I was still learning.
As I develop, as I work harder, I will certainly look back at this mini-project. 
The project is open to comments and suggestions for possible code changes and other things!

There are hundreds of different file extensions and file types used with computers. However, it would be impossible for most people to memorize all file extensions and their associated programs.
I completed the file extensions using this site: https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001789.htm#.

It is inevitable that it would be possible to write a program for all file extensions, because there are countless extensions.
I've used as many of the most common file extensions as possible that a programmer's computer might have.

Also, I've used a closer version to avoid confusion with the .bin, .msi, .py, .cgi, .pl, .ico extensions.
 Because the extensions I listed could not be attributed to only 1 type of extension. I mean:
 
.bin -> Executable, Disc and media

.msi -> Executable, System related

.py -> Executable, Internet-related, Programming

.cgi -> Executable, Internet-related, Programming

.pl -> Executable, Internet-related, Programming

.ico -> Image, System related

Therefore, I had to attribute it to a closer version. But I know it's not that hard to fix. I will definitely try to solve this problem in the future.
